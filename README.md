# image_processing
Project #1 of my python courses, here is a jpg to png program. As the name suggests, it converts a jpg file to a png.

Please first install the required library:
```terminal
pip3 install PIL
```

To run the program, you can clone the repo and type this line into your terminal:
```terminal
python3 jpg_to_png.py /pokedex /new
```

"/new" stands for the name of the folder that will receive the converted files. You can type any name you want.
- **Do not forget that for the folder names, you have to end them with a "/". If you're using Windows, replace them with a "\\" instead**
